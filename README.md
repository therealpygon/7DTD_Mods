## therealpygon's 7 Days to Die Mods

Custom mods that add specific features I wanted to the game.

* BetterZombieSight: Fork of Adredens BetterZomebie but with reduced range; slight improvement over base range to make it more compatible with increased spawn rates.
* BowCrossbowParts: Makes bow/crossbow parts craftable at the tablesaw.
* ZombieNerf: Reduces damage by zombies to ~75%, significantly reduces their damage to blocks (because lets be real, a fist < concrete block). Works well with increased spawn rates/larger groups.
* SteelBars: Adds upgrade from ironBars (2500) to steelBars (5000) plus forge crafting recipe.
